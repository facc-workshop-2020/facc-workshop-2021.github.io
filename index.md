title: Formal Approaches to Certifying Compliance (FACC)
---

An online workshop on applying formal methods tools and techniques to certification and compliance problems. 

FACC taking place 8am - 2pm Pacific time on July 19th. FACC will be affiliated to the CAV conference and registration will take place through CAV’s system: [http://i-cav.org/2021/](http://i-cav.org/2021/)


### Topic 

Regulatory compliance is a requirement for many types of software systems. For example, cryptographic systems may be subject to FIPS certifications, medical data systems must be HIPAA compliant, safety critical systems must adhere to standards such as ISO 26262 and DO-178C, and cloud services used by the US government must achieve FedRAMP designation. Even after software is built and certified, changes to the software, no matter how minor, must often be recertified to ensure that they do not break previously-held assumptions.

Unfortunately, current approaches to compliance can be slow-moving and expensive. This pace directly clashes with modern software development, which is characterized by rapid change and enormous scale. For many organizations compliance imposes unacceptable cost and delay when shipping industry-strength software. In addition, compliance can perversely result in less reliable software, as bug fixes are delayed by certification processes. 

Formal methods may offer solutions to this problem. We seek formal methods tools, solutions, capabilities, or techniques that can be inserted into certification processes to make them cheaper, faster, and more rigorous. 

The FACC workshop will explore how formal methods tools and techniques can increase automation in compliance processes, and thereby help build software more cheaply and reliably. Our aim is to bring together industry, government, and academic experts to share ideas, scope problems, and develop future collaborations.

Topics of interest: 

* Test synthesis
* Formal verification techniques
* Enforcement of security controls
* Detecting and analyzing changes
* Automatically invalidating and regenerating evidence
* Case studies and experience reports

### Call for talks 

We invite proposals of talks to take place at FACC. Talks will be 20 minutes long with 5-10 minutes following for questions and discussion. We encourage talks that take a broad and forward-looking perspective, as well as talks with deep technical content. 

Proposals should consist of an abstract of 200 words or less explaining the topic of the proposed talk , and an author biography of 100 words or less. 

Proposals should be emailed to [Mike Dodds](mailto:miked@galois.com) with the subject heading “FACC talk proposal”. 

Important dates: 
* Deadline for talk proposals: 11th June 2021
* Notification: 18th June 2021
